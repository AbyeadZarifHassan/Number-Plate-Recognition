# Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) System 🇧🇩

A **classical computer vision-based Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR)** system designed for detecting and recognizing **Bangladeshi vehicle license plates** using **OpenCV morphological processing** and **Tesseract OCR**.

This project follows a traditional pipeline (no deep learning) and was developed as an undergraduate Computer Vision course project.
